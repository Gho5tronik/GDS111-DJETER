	<H2>My Bio<H2>
	<img src="Callsign haunted.jpg" alt="Image Description">
	<p>  I've been ariund computers since I was 3. I infected my Dad's computer with a virus when I was 7, and fixed through trial and error, and that's when my parents decided technology just might be my thing. I've always been a C-ish student in school, but I've been told I could be an A student if I applied myself more. I still haven't fulfilled that promise. I suffer from ADHD, and it affects my ability to think abstractly, and digest concepts theoretically. I became obsessed with learning the ins and outs of it, so that I could better manage my strengths and weaknesses. I'm not far from an adept competence of it. People have always associated my inability to concentrate, or process things on a deeper level with laziness, but I vehemently feel this isn't the case. When I'm able to pair words with visuals, and practice the theories I'm learning, I feel as though I can keep up with anyone. My empathy skills are situational at best, so I keep to myself usually. That ties back into my inability to concentrate on what they are saying to figure out if I want to be apart of their discussion or not. </p>
